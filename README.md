# NBAplayerRoleAnalysis
# Final Project for BYGB7978 at Fordham University

## Introduction
In the past decades of years, NBA basketball players have been divided into five positions, including Centre, Power Forward, Small Forward, Position Guard, and Shooting Guard. However, with the springing up of Golden State Warriors, a ‘small ball’ strategy has emerged. Under this sports fashion, players of a team are more flexible and convertible. The traditional basketball player categories are facing out of use and a waste of sportsman’s talent and developing draft picks that do not fit their systems. Actually, NBA observers and coaches have already noticed nowadays players have skills that exceed their predefined positions and even already defined some new roles such as combo guard(guard has both shooting and organizing skills of SG and PG). Scouts and coaches are needing a new way to recognize and classify potential players. Our research is conducted according to the various skills of a player and assort them into eight new positions. On the basis of that, we can form a new player-type system and help the team to train more efficiently.

## Data Analysis 
### Text
We divide our analysis into two main counterparts. In the first section, we define new player roles by using text analytics techniques to support the second section, predictive analysis. In the second section, we apply KMeans Clustering to come up with 8 player types. Ideally, the first part should work to provide solid explanations and support to the result of the second part, which are the final clusters we received from KMeans Clustering.
